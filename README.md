### Torsten Grust

I am a professor of Computer Science at University of TÃ¼bingen (Germany), performing research into the design, compilation, optimization, and evaluation of **database query languages.**  In our work, we often walk the fine line between database query and programming language technology. My group develops techniques that turn relational database systems into scalable processors also for non-relational query and programming languages. I am at my happiest whenever I find new evidence that database and programming language research can mutually benefit each other.
